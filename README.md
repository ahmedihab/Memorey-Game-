Memory Game

A JavaScript Practice Project

This project is a simple Memory Matching Game created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
It was built as a learning exercise to practice JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and interactive UI design.

🎮 How the Game Works

The game contains a set of cards placed face-down.

The player flips two cards at a time to find matching pairs.

If the two flipped cards match, they stay visible.

If they don’t match, they flip back after a short delay.

The game continues until all pairs are found.

When the player finds all matches, the game displays a message that they won and the game ends.

If your version includes move counting or time limits, I can add that too — just let me know!
